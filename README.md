This project is inspired by a dataset provided on kaggle.com. You can download the dataset using this link :

The project aims to recognize bird species from 525 species (approximately).
Because it's a study project, we explored different methods, even if we knew some would not work well compared to Deep Learning.
For instance, we worked on a Machine Learning model, based on the color repartition (RGB) of the images to predict the specie of the bird.
It was obvisous that the results were not great, but still it was interesting to apply what we studied, and to try to get the best model
even for such a complex task.
Finally, after several tests with models made from scratch and using transfer learning, we figured out the best model to use is
EfficientNetB2.

The rest of the project was dedicated to the writing of a report (in french) and to propose a light production implementation
using Streamlit.
